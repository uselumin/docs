# Custom Events

Custom events allow you to define your own KPIs. Each custom event you send will be counted and displayed in your dashboard.

To send a custom event from your app, use the `.trackCustomEvent()` method on the `Lumin` instance.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">

```jsx
<Button
  title="Track Custom Event"
  onPress={() => {
    lumin.trackCustomEvent('CUSTOM_EVENT_NAME');
  }}
/>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flutter" label="Flutter">

```dart
Lumin.instance.trackCustomEvent("EVENT_NAME");
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Sharing One Lumin Instace Across Your App

:::info

This is only relevant in React Native. In Flutter, no further setup is needed, one instance of Lumin is already shared across your app.

:::

When you're tracking custom events, you likely won't do so only from your `App.js`. So we recommend to pull your Lumin setup code out of `App.js` into its own module. Here's an example of how you can do that in React Native:

```javascript title="lumin.js"
import { Lumin } from "@uselumin/react-native";

const lumin = null;
if (process.env.ENVIRONMENT === "production") {
    lumin = new Lumin("<Token of your PROD Lumin app>");
} else 
if (process.env.ENVIRONMENT === "development") {
    lumin = new Lumin("<Token of your DEV Lumin app>");
} else
if // ...

lumin.init();

export lumin;
```
