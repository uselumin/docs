# Having Multiple Apps

You can track as many apps from one Lumin account as you want. Your price tier will be determined based on the combined MAUs of all your apps.

## Create Additional Apps

Click on "Apps" in the sidebar to view the list of all your apps. 

![App List](./img/appList.png)

To create additional apps, click on the button labeled "Add App +" in the upper right corner.

![Create App](img/createApp.png)

Afterwards, you will be shown instructions for how to integrate Lumin into your app.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native" default>

Install the Lumin React Native SDK and its dependencies:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
  npm install @uselumin/react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.17.11
  npx pod-install # Not needed if you're using Expo
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" default>

```bash
  yarn add @uselumin/react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.17.11
  npx pod-install # Not needed if you're using Expo
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Intitialize the Lumin SDK in your app (e.g. in App.js):

```jsx title="App.js"
import { Lumin } from "@uselumin/react-native";

const lumin = new Lumin("<Your Token>");

lumin.init();
```

The above code snippet will already be populated with the correct token.

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flutter" label="Flutter">
    Install the Lumin Flutter SDK and its dependencies:

```bash
dart pub add lumin_flutter
```

Then, intialize Lumin in your `main` function:

```dart
import 'package:lumin_flutter/lumin_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await Lumin.init("<Your Lumin App Token>");

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

The above code snippet will already be populated with the correct token.

Finally, wrap your app in the `LuminLifecycleLogger` widget:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LuminLifecycleLogger(
      child: MaterialApp(
        // ...
      )
    );
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">
    Coming soon!
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    Coming soon!
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you open your app for the first time (or send a [Custom Event](./custom-events)), your dashboard should show your statistics.

:::caution

Each app will have a different token, so make sure you use the correct one.
