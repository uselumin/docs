# Create an Account

The first thing you'll have to do is sign up for a Lumin account. We have a generous free tier that should be enough to get you started with your app. No credit card required.

## Sign Up

Head over to [https://app.uselumin.co](https://app.uselumin.co) and either put in your Email or use your Discord account to sign up. You don't need a password for Lumin!

## Check Your Inbox

If you choose Email, you should get a signup link in your inbox pretty much instantly. Click that and you're good to go!

If you don't get an Email after a few minutes, check your spam folder and check if you typed your Email correctly. If you still don't get anything, [contact us](mailto:jonas@uselumin.co).
